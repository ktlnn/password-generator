# password-generator

## Project Description 
- In this project, I created a random password generator mainly using javascript. I implemented loops (for and while), if/else statements, prompts, and confirms. 
- The password generator works by clicking the "Generate Password" button, then the user will be prompted to choose the length and which type of characters they want to include. 
The password will then be displayed onto the page.
